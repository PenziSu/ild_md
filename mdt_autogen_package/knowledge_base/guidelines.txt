# Assessment and Monitoring of Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) – Tools, Interpretation, and Clinical Decision-Making

## Introduction

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders characterized by varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Over the past five years, high-impact studies and consensus guidelines have emphasized a multi-disciplinary approach to ILD – combining clinical evaluation with **laboratory tests**, **pulmonary function testing**, **exercise assessments**, and **high-resolution imaging** – to achieve an accurate diagnosis and to tailor monitoring for disease progression. An accurate initial diagnosis is paramount, as it directs appropriate management (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory ILDs or antifibrotics for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and a logical, case-by-case monitoring strategy is needed given the variable presentations and rates of progression in ILDs. Below, we summarize recent evidence on how to interpret key assessment tools in ILD care, and we provide structured guidance on using these tools to answer common clinical questions in ILD management.

## Laboratory Investigations in ILD

**Role and Interpretation:** Laboratory tests in ILD serve primarily to **identify underlying causes or associated conditions** and to aid in risk stratification. High-impact reviews and guidelines recommend a thorough autoimmune serological panel in every new ILD patient to evaluate for a connective tissue disease (CTD) or autoimmune process. Positive autoantibodies (e.g. ANA, RF, anti-CCP, anti-synthetase, anti-Scl-70) or other CTD markers indicate a CTD-ILD rather than an idiopathic ILD, which crucially alters management. For example, the presence of rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP in a patient with ILD strongly suggests rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD, prompting treatment of the underlying rheumatic disease. In “idiopathic” cases, a negative autoimmune workup is necessary before diagnosing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or idiopathic NSIP. In recent years, researchers have also identified blood **biomarkers** that correlate with ILD activity and prognosis. For instance, high circulating levels of **KL-6** (a mucin glycoprotein) have been associated with greater disease extent and worse survival in ILD (including CTD-ILD). A 2021 proteomic analysis in *Lancet Respiratory Medicine* identified a novel plasma protein signature that predicts risk of fibrosis progression in ILD, underscoring the potential of blood biomarkers in prognostication. While such biomarkers are not yet routine, they may complement traditional tests: for example, **surfactant proteins** (SP-A, SP-D) and **matrix metalloproteinase-7** have been studied as markers of IPF severity. In practice, **inflammatory markers** (ESR, CRP) are non-specific but a markedly elevated CRP or ferritin might suggest an active inflammatory component (e.g. organizing pneumonia overlap or CTD flare). **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis** (HP) workup may include IgG precipitin panels against suspected antigens; positive results can support an HP diagnosis, though they must be correlated with exposure history and imaging (given imperfect specificity). In summary, lab tests help answer “*Why* does this patient have ILD?” and sometimes “*How severe or active* is it?” – e.g., a change in autoimmune titer or rising KL-6 might signal a change in disease activity – thereby guiding further diagnostic steps and therapy choices.

## Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)

**Role and Interpretation:** PFTs are a cornerstone of ILD assessment, providing objective measures of lung capacity and gas exchange that reflect disease severity and progression. Most ILDs cause a **restrictive defect** on spirometry (reduced forced vital capacity, FVC, with preserved or elevated FEV1/FVC ratio) and a **reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL\_CO)**, reflecting impaired gas transfer due to interstitial thickening. The typical pattern is a proportional decline in FVC and DL\_CO; these parameters are so central that they form the basis of common ILD severity indices. At baseline, marked reductions in % predicted FVC or DL\_CO correlate with greater fibrosis extent on HRCT and higher mortality risk (e.g., in scleroderma-ILD, low DL\_CO and FVC are predictors of mortality). Just as importantly, **serial PFT trends** are critical for monitoring ILD: a decline in FVC or DL\_CO over time often signals disease progression. Both clinical trials and recent guidelines define “meaningful” ILD progression by threshold declines in lung function. A relative decline in FVC ≥10% (of predicted value) within 6–12 months is widely considered significant and is associated with increased mortality. Smaller declines (e.g. 5–9% FVC drop) may also indicate progression if accompanied by worsening symptoms or imaging changes. For DL\_CO, a drop ≥15% is often considered significant, though DL\_CO is more variable in testing. Notably, a recent analysis confirmed that once a fibrotic ILD has entered a progressive phase (meeting such decline criteria), the **risk of death becomes similarly elevated across ILD subtypes** – reinforcing that PFT decline is a universal red flag. On the other hand, stable or improving PFTs (as sometimes seen in inflammatory ILDs on therapy) indicate disease stability or response. PFT results also aid in **risk stratification**: composite scores like the GAP index (which includes FVC and DL\_CO along with age and gender) help predict 1-year mortality in ILD, and the Composite Physiologic Index (CPI) uses FVC, DL\_CO, and FEV1 to estimate fibrosis extent. When interpreting PFTs, one must consider test quality and comorbidities (e.g. concomitant emphysema can normalize lung volumes despite fibrosis – the so-called “occult” ILD in combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema). Overall, PFTs answer the questions “*How much lung function is lost?*” and “*Is the disease getting worse?*”. A clear example from recent trials is the use of **FVC decline as a primary endpoint**: in the INBUILD study of fibrosing ILDs, the antifibrotic nintedanib significantly reduced the rate of FVC decline compared to placebo, confirming that serial FVC tracks disease behavior and treatment response. Therefore, regular PFT monitoring (every 3–6 months for progressive diseases) is recommended to detect early changes; a sudden drop should prompt evaluation for reversible causes (e.g. acute exacerbation or heart failure) versus true fibrosis progression.

## Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)

**Role and Interpretation:** The 6MWT is a simple exercise test that assesses **functional exercise capacity** and gas exchange in ILD patients. The patient walks for 6 minutes, and key outcomes are the **distance walked (6MWD)** and **oxygen saturation** response. ILD patients often show reduced 6MWD and exertional oxygen desaturation due to diffusion impairment and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Research in the last few years has solidified the prognostic value of the 6MWT in fibrotic ILDs. For example, a 2023 multicenter study in *Chest* found that patients with progressive fibrotic ILD experience an annual decline in 6MWD (and related indices like distance–saturation product), whereas those with non-progressive disease can even improve their distances. Moreover, the **degree of desaturation during 6MWT** is a powerful marker: new-onset exertional hypoxemia was independently associated with worse transplant-free survival in both IPF and other ILDs. In practical terms, a baseline 6MWD below a certain threshold (e.g. <250–300 meters) or a drop in SpO₂ below 88% during the walk is associated with higher mortality and need for oxygen therapy. A review of IPF patients confirmed that a low baseline 6MWD, as well as a ≥50–100 meter decrease in 6MWD over 6–12 months, correlates with significantly increased mortality. Thus, serial 6MWTs can help monitor disease trajectory: a shortening 6MWD or worsening desaturation suggests progression even if PFT changes are borderline. The 6MWT also guides management like supplemental oxygen prescription – if a patient desaturates (e.g. <88%) during the test, they meet criteria for ambulatory oxygen, which can improve exercise capacity and life quality. Recent studies are exploring additional 6MWT-derived metrics; for instance, the **distance-saturation product** (6MWD × nadir SpO₂) or an **oxygen uptake efficiency plateau** have been proposed to quantify combined exercise performance. Clinically, interpretation of 6MWT in ILD focuses on: (1) **Distance** – significantly lower than normal suggests advanced disease; (2) **Desaturation** – significant drop indicates impaired gas exchange; and (3) **Symptoms** – increased Borg dyspnea score or inability to complete the test suggests poor functional status. Overall, the 6MWT addresses “*How limited is the patient in daily activity?*” and, when repeated over time, “*Is functional capacity worsening?*”. It adds real-world context to the physiologic measurements: for example, two patients with similar FVC might have different exercise tolerance and prognosis based on their 6MWT results.

## High-Resolution CT (HRCT) Imaging

**Role and Interpretation:** **High-resolution CT** of the chest is the gold-standard imaging tool for ILD detection, characterization, and monitoring. HRCT can identify the presence of ILD and often suggests a specific pattern or diagnosis based on the distribution and morphology of lung abnormalities. Over the past five years, there have been important refinements in how HRCT findings are classified and used in ILD management:

* **Diagnosing ILD:** A normal chest X-ray can miss early ILD, but HRCT is highly sensitive to interstitial changes (ground-glass opacities, septal lines, nodules, honeycombing). Thus, when ILD is suspected clinically (unexplained exertional dyspnea with velcro-like crackles, etc.), an HRCT is typically the first confirmatory test – answering “*Is it ILD?*” definitively by visualizing interstitial fibrosis or inflammation. Characteristic patterns on HRCT not only confirm ILD but also narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, **basal subpleural reticular opacities with honeycombing** indicate a **UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) pattern**, whereas **diffuse ground-glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis but no honeycombing** suggest an **NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia) pattern**. **Upper-lobe predominant fibrosis with airway-centered changes and mosaic attenuation** would point toward chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and **perilymphatic nodules** would suggest sarcoidosis, and so on. Recent international guidelines (ATS/ERS 2018, updated 2022) formalized HRCT pattern categories for IPF diagnosis: **“UIP”, “Probable UIP”, “Indeterminate for UIP”,** or **“Alternative diagnosis”**, based on specific imaging criteria. A **definite UIP pattern** on HRCT (honeycombing with subpleural, basal predominance and no atypical features) in a patient with no identifiable cause essentially secures a diagnosis of IPF without need for lung biopsy. By contrast, an **indeterminate** pattern (some fibrosis present but atypical or insufficient for UIP) might necessitate further evaluation (e.g. biopsy) to determine the ILD subtype. Importantly, studies have shown that certain HRCT features carry prognostic weight: for instance, the mere presence of **honeycombing** on CT (a UIP hallmark) identifies a more **progressive fibrotic phenotype with increased mortality risk** across ILDs. Extent of fibrosis on HRCT is another prognostic indicator – a larger fibrotic extent has been linked to higher mortality and likelihood of progression. Modern quantitative imaging research using computer algorithms and deep learning is promising: quantitative fibrosis scores or texture analysis of HRCT can predict FVC decline and mortality, potentially even before overt PFT changes. However, as an expert consensus noted, such **AI-driven HRCT analysis** tools, while “exciting,” still **await validation** for routine practice.
* **Serial HRCT for Monitoring:** How and when to use repeat HRCT is a nuanced decision. Because ILD progression is often slow and HRCT entails radiation, clinicians typically **do not perform HRCT at every follow-up** but rather when results will change management (e.g. unexplained acute worsening or to evaluate a suspected complication). Serial HRCT can reveal **interval progression of fibrosis** – for example, increasing reticulation, new honeycombing, or volume loss compared to prior scans indicate disease progression, even if PFT changes are marginal. HRCT can also detect new features that suggest complications or overlapping processes: development of emphysema blebs, pulmonary hypertension signs (enlarged pulmonary artery), or lung cancer nodules (since ILD patients have elevated risk) can all be seen on HRCT. In patients on therapy, **resolution of ground-glass opacities** or **decreased consolidation** may signify response (especially in organizing pneumonia or acute inflammatory exacerbations), whereas **worsening fibrosis** despite therapy might prompt escalation or switch of treatment. Notably, a recent study suggested that even **visual semi-quantitative scoring** of fibrosis changes on serial HRCT correlates with outcome in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. In practice, if a patient’s symptoms or PFTs worsen and the cause is unclear, a repeat HRCT helps distinguish **true fibrotic progression** from other issues (like new infection, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary embolism superimposed on ILD). Current expert guidance is to use HRCT judiciously in monitoring: it is invaluable when questions arise (e.g. “Has this NSIP evolved into a UIP pattern over time?” or “Is there new ground-glass suggesting active inflammation that might respond to steroids?”), but routine scanning at fixed intervals is not generally recommended due to radiation and cost. As technology advances (e.g. ultra-high-resolution, photon-counting CT with lower dose), future practice might incorporate more frequent imaging if it provides earlier detection of progression.

## Cardiac Ultrasound (Echocardiography)

**Role and Interpretation:** **Cardiac ultrasound**, or transthoracic echocardiography, is a non-invasive tool to evaluate heart function and estimate pulmonary artery pressures. In ILD management, its primary role is to screen for and monitor **pulmonary hypertension (PH)** and right heart strain, which are important comorbidities affecting prognosis. Fibrotic ILDs, especially in advanced stages, can lead to PH due to chronic hypoxic vasoconstriction and vascular destruction (classified as WHO Group III PH). The presence of PH in ILD significantly **worsens prognosis** – studies show that ILD patients who develop secondary PH have higher mortality than those without PH. For example, an IPF patient with a high estimated systolic PAP on echo has a much shorter median survival than an IPF patient with normal pressures. Echocardiography in ILD assessment focuses on findings such as: **elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP)** as an estimate of pulmonary artery pressure, **right atrial and ventricular enlargement**, and **septal flattening or interventricular septal shift** (signs of right heart overload). If an echocardiogram suggests PH (e.g. estimated RVSP >40–50 mmHg with supportive signs), the next step is often to confirm with right heart catheterization, especially if considering PH-specific therapy. However, even without invasive confirmation, an echo indicating PH prompts closer monitoring, oxygen optimization, and consideration of referral to specialized centers. Recent years have seen progress in managing ILD-associated PH: for instance, a 2021 trial (published in NEJM) showed that **inhaled treprostinil** improved exercise capacity in IPF/ILD patients with confirmed PH, highlighting the importance of detecting PH as we now have some therapy that can help. Thus, interpreting echo results can directly influence management – e.g., an ILD patient with rising PAP on echo despite stable lung function might need evaluation for pulmonary vasodilators or earlier transplant referral. Echocardiography can also reveal **left heart dysfunction** (like HFpEF) that might be contributing to symptoms instead of or in addition to ILD; differentiating this is crucial, as treating heart failure differs from treating ILD. In summary, cardiac ultrasound answers “*Is there pulmonary hypertension or cardiac involvement complicating the ILD?*”. A normal echocardiogram at baseline is reassuring, but given that PH can develop later, many experts repeat an echo in ILD patients if unexplained exercise intolerance or signs of right heart strain appear. Some guidelines for specific diseases (e.g. systemic sclerosis) even suggest annual screening echos to catch early PH. The overarching message from recent literature is that **PH should be actively looked for in fibrotic ILD**, because its presence portends worse outcomes and may open additional management pathways.

## Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)

**Role and Interpretation:** **CPET** is a comprehensive exercise test that analyzes respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic responses during incremental exercise (usually on a cycle or treadmill). In ILD, CPET provides granular insights into exercise limitation and can help distinguish whether dyspnea is primarily due to pulmonary dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, or deconditioning. Although CPET is more specialized than the 6MWT, research supports its utility in ILD for both diagnostic clarification and prognostication. Key CPET findings in ILD often include: **reduced peak oxygen uptake (VO₂peak)**, reflecting diminished pulmonary oxygen transport; an **abnormally steep ventilatory equivalent for CO₂ (VE/VCO₂ slope)** and low end-tidal CO₂, indicating inefficient gas exchange (often due to ventilation–perfusion mismatch and high dead space); **exercise-induced hypoxemia**; and a **reduced oxygen pulse** (O₂ per heartbeat), which can signify circulatory impairment or poor stroke volume. One classic CPET pattern in ILD is a **ventilatory limitation** – patients reach near-maximal breathing (high breathing reserve utilization) due to restrictive lungs before reaching their cardiovascular limit. However, if concomitant PH is present, a **circulatory limitation** may dominate (early plateau of O₂ pulse, hypotensive response). In practical terms, CPET can answer “*Is the exercise limitation in this ILD patient due to the lungs, heart, or both?*”. For example, a patient with ILD and unexplained severe exercise intolerance might undergo CPET: if CPET shows a pattern of **low VO₂max with a normal cardiovascular response but extreme hyperventilation and gas exchange abnormalities**, it confirms the lungs as the limiting factor. Conversely, if CPET shows an inappropriately low blood pressure response and low O₂ pulse, a cardiac contribution (or PH) is likely. Prognostically, multiple studies (summarized in a 2022 review) have reported that at least one CPET parameter is predictive of mortality in ILD. In particular, a very low **peak VO₂** or **peak work rate** has been consistently associated with higher risk of death or need for transplant. One study found that a **peak workload** below \~50% predicted was highly discriminatory for one-year mortality in ILD patients. Another investigation derived a composite score of CPET variables (VO₂, VE/VCO₂, etc.) that stratified 1-year survival in ILD. Thus, CPET offers prognostic information beyond resting PFTs. It may identify high-risk patients who have significant exercise impairment despite mildly reduced resting lung volumes. CPET is also valuable in early ILD or in symptomatic patients with normal PFTs: it can unmask gas exchange abnormalities during exercise, prompting further ILD evaluation. However, CPET is resource-intensive and not needed for every ILD patient. Its use is targeted – for example, in workup of unexplained dyspnea (to differentiate ILD vs cardiac vs deconditioning), or in research settings to quantify response to therapy (some trials use VO₂ changes as endpoints). When interpreting CPET in ILD, clinicians focus on patterns: a **pulmonary limited pattern** (low VO₂, early metabolic acidosis due to shallow breathing, high VE/VCO₂) supports ILD as the cause of dyspnea, whereas a **normal CPET** would prompt looking for non-cardiopulmonary causes (like poor fitness or anemia). In summary, CPET is a sophisticated tool that, in the context of ILD, helps answer “*How do the lungs (and heart) perform under stress?*” and “*Does this patient’s physiology suggest a worse prognosis?*”. Preliminary evidence suggests that incorporating CPET into ILD assessment can refine risk stratification, though its routine use remains debated and is usually at specialized centers.

## Using Assessments to Guide Key Clinical Questions in ILD

Given the above tools and their interpretations, clinicians integrate the data to address crucial decision points in ILD management. Below are common clinical questions and how the assessments collectively inform them:

### **1. Is it ILD?** (Differentiating ILD from other causes of respiratory symptoms)

When a patient presents with progressive dyspnea, cough, inspiratory crackles, or characteristic risk factors, the first question is whether an interstitial lung disease is present. **HRCT** is the decisive test: the presence of interstitial changes on HRCT (ground-glass opacities, reticulations, honeycombing, etc.) confirms ILD and distinguishes it from other etiologies like heart failure or COPD. **Pulmonary function tests** support this by showing a restrictive pattern with low diffusion capacity, which, in the appropriate clinical context, strongly points to ILD rather than purely airway disease. For example, a patient with exertional dyspnea and crackles who has an FVC 60% predicted and DL\_CO 40% predicted is very likely to have ILD; if their HRCT then shows basal reticulations, the diagnosis is established. **Laboratory tests** aid in excluding other diagnoses (e.g., BNP to screen for cardiac failure, or ruling out chronic infections) and in identifying contributors (an elevated ANCA might suggest an ILD from vasculitis, etc.). A **6MWT** can reveal significant exercise-induced desaturation, which is more typical of ILD or pulmonary vascular disease than of purely cardiac or muscular causes. **CPET**, if needed, can further confirm a pulmonary limitation as the cause of exercise intolerance (e.g., a pattern of high ventilatory drive and low end-tidal CO₂), thus supporting ILD. In summary, a compatible clinical picture plus: **HRCT evidence of interstitial changes** is usually definitive for “it is ILD.” If the HRCT is *normal* or equivocal but suspicion remains high, repeating imaging in a few months or obtaining an atypical HRCT (prone positioning, expiratory scans for subtle air-trapping) may be considered. In the absence of HRCT findings, ILD is unlikely, and one should reconsider alternative diagnoses. High-impact research emphasizes early use of HRCT in the diagnostic algorithm; this has improved ILD detection rates and reduced misdiagnoses.

### **2. Indeterminate findings – is the ILD pattern “Indeterminate for UIP”?**

In some cases, an HRCT shows abnormalities that are **inconclusive** – not clearly UIP but not clearly another pattern either. This scenario is labeled “indeterminate for UIP” in IPF diagnostic guidelines. It raises the question of how to proceed to nail down the diagnosis. When confronted with indeterminate imaging, clinicians leverage other tools and strategies:

* **Multidisciplinary Discussion (MDD):** First, an experienced ILD team (radiologist, pulmonologist, sometimes pathologist and rheumatologist) will review the case. Indeterminate HRCT (for example, patchy fibrosis without classic UIP features) might be re-examined in light of clinical data. Sometimes subtle clues (e.g. air-trapping suggesting chronic HP, or slight peribronchovascular predominance hinting at NSIP) can tilt the interpretation.
* **Laboratory and Clinical Correlation:** An indeterminate pattern should prompt a meticulous search for underlying causes. Extended autoimmune serologies, occupational and exposure histories, and even **bronchoalveolar lavage** (to check for lymphocytosis suggesting HP) are considered. If, for instance, an “indeterminate” HRCT comes with positive anti-synthetase antibodies and mechanics’ hands on exam, one might diagnose an autoimmune ILD (antisynthetase syndrome) rather than idiopathic fibrosis.
* **Lung Biopsy for Histopathology:** When uncertainty remains, obtaining lung tissue can be decisive. The past five years brought advances in less invasive biopsy techniques: **transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC)** has emerged as an acceptable alternative to surgical biopsy in experienced centers. The 2022 ATS/ERS guideline update made a conditional recommendation that cryobiopsy can be used instead of surgical biopsy for diagnosing IPF, given proper expertise. A cryobiopsy or surgical biopsy can reveal a histologic UIP pattern, NSIP, HP, etc., clarifying the diagnosis even if HRCT was indeterminate.
* **Follow-Up Imaging:** Sometimes “indeterminate” simply means early or mild disease. Serial HRCT six months later might show progression towards a more recognizable pattern (e.g. new honeycombing, confirming UIP/IPF). However, this must be balanced against the risk of waiting without treatment if the disease is active.

In summary, an indeterminate HRCT warrants **additional data gathering**. The goal is to avoid misclassification; as one commentary noted, reconciling indeterminate imaging with clinical context or pathology is crucial for correct diagnosis. With these steps, the question becomes answerable: if subsequent biopsy shows UIP, it was IPF; if it shows organizing pneumonia or NSIP, then the ILD is of a different type. High-impact studies have reported that employing cryobiopsy and MDD can significantly increase diagnostic confidence in indeterminate cases, thereby reducing the number of “unclassifiable ILD” diagnoses.

### **3. Is it UIP (Usual Interstitial Pneumonia pattern)?**

Determining whether an ILD has a UIP pattern is vital because **UIP is the hallmark pattern of IPF** (when no cause is found) and can also appear in other fibrosing ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD). The assessments answer this question primarily through imaging and, if needed, pathology:

* **HRCT:** A **definite UIP pattern on HRCT** is defined by features such as **honeycombing with peripheral, basal predominance, reticular fibrosis, and absence of inconsistent features (like nodules, diffuse ground-glass or upper lobe predominance)**. If these criteria are met, one can confidently say “Yes, it is UIP.” For example, an HRCT showing patchy subpleural reticulation and honeycomb cysts in both lung bases with no ground-glass except in areas of fibrosis would be classic UIP. Recent high-impact analyses confirm that such HRCT-diagnosed UIP correlates strongly with histopathologic UIP and has prognostic significance (patients with UIP pattern have a more fibrotic, progressive course on average). **Probable UIP** (reticulation and traction bronchiectasis without honeycombing) also strongly suggests UIP, though definitive diagnosis may then rely on biopsy or clinical judgment.
* **Histopathology:** If imaging is not definitive, a lung biopsy can identify UIP pathologically (characterized by patchy fibrosis with fibroblastic foci and honeycomb change). When a biopsy finds UIP pattern and no alternative cause is evident, the diagnosis is IPF. In patients with an underlying CTD or exposure, finding UIP pathology would indicate that etiology (e.g. “UIP pattern secondary to rheumatoid arthritis”).
* **Other tools:** No blood test can directly tell UIP vs NSIP, but sometimes **biomarkers** differ in UIP/IPF (for example, MUC5B gene variant is prevalent in IPF-UIP but that’s a genetic risk factor, not diagnostic). Some studies have explored serum **periostin** or **MMP7** as higher in UIP/IPF, but these are not specific enough clinically. Thus, we rely on imaging ± biopsy.

In clinical practice, asking “Is it UIP?” really means **“Does this patient have IPF or an IPF-like pattern?”** because UIP drives decisions about antifibrotic therapy (which is indicated for IPF/UIP). If the answer is yes (confirmed UIP pattern), one then looks for causes: if none, it’s idiopathic (IPF); if yes (like collagen vascular disease), it’s UIP due to that cause but still prognostically important (since UIP confers a risk of progression). It’s worth noting that some CTD-ILDs can exhibit UIP pattern (e.g. about 20–30% of RA-ILD can be UIP). Those patients might benefit from similar treatments as IPF. Recent data suggest that **UIP pattern, regardless of cause, portends a more progressive disease course**. Therefore, identifying UIP is crucial. The **bottom line:** **HRCT is the key** – if classic UIP features are present, the question is answered affirmatively without invasive testing. If HRCT is equivocal, a biopsy is considered; if that shows UIP, the answer is yes. High-impact studies and guidelines underscore that the accuracy of UIP identification has improved with better HRCT criteria and multidisciplinary expertise, reducing the need for surgical biopsy in many cases.

### **4. Is there an NSIP pattern (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia)?**

NSIP is a pattern characterized by more uniform, diffuse lung involvement with **ground-glass opacities, fine reticulation, and minimal honeycombing**. It is often associated with **autoimmune ILDs** (such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis) or can be idiopathic. Determining if the pattern is NSIP has implications: NSIP tends to respond better to immunosuppressive therapy and can have a more favorable prognosis than UIP (especially the **cellular NSIP** subtype). Here’s how assessments help:

* **HRCT:** NSIP on HRCT classically shows **bilateral, symmetric ground-glass opacities and reticular lines, often in a basal distribution, sometimes with subpleural sparing**. There is less architectural distortion than UIP and **little or no honeycombing**. If an ILD patient’s HRCT shows these features, one would say “the pattern looks like NSIP.” For example, in a young woman with ILD, an HRCT demonstrating diffuse ground-glass with fine reticular lines and no honeycomb strongly suggests NSIP; this might prompt a workup for underlying CTD. Some fibrotic NSIP cases do have reticulation and traction bronchiectasis, but the key is the **homogeneity of the fibrosis and ground-glass** compared to the patchy heterogeneity of UIP. Over the last few years, studies in systemic sclerosis-ILD have reinforced that HRCT patterns are often NSIP and that the **extent of fibrosis on HRCT predicts outcomes in NSIP as well**. If serial HRCTs of an NSIP patient begin to show emerging honeycombing, this may indicate transition to a more UIP-like pattern, which is associated with a worse prognosis.
* **Histopathology:** If imaging is unclear, lung biopsy can confirm NSIP pattern (pathologically characterized by uniform interstitial inflammation and fibrosis at the same stage of evolution throughout the sample, lacking the patchy variation of UIP). This is especially useful in distinguishing idiopathic NSIP from chronic HP or organizing pneumonia, which can sometimes mimic NSIP on imaging.
* **Clinical context and labs:** The question “NSIP pattern?” is often answered in tandem with “is there an autoimmune cause?”. A positive ANA, scleroderma-specific antibodies, or clinical features like Raynaud’s phenomenon strongly suggest a CTD-ILD, of which NSIP is the prototypical pattern. Thus, recognizing NSIP on the scan often pushes the clinician to search for an underlying CTD if not already known. Conversely, in a known CTD patient, seeing NSIP on HRCT (as opposed to UIP) might influence therapy (e.g. more immunosuppression rather than immediately starting antifibrotic).
* **Monitoring NSIP:** On follow-up, **disease behavior in NSIP** can vary – some patients improve with treatment (ground-glass areas clear up), some remain stable, and some progress (fibrosis increases). HRCT is sensitive to these changes: increasing reticulation or any development of honeycombing would indicate a shift toward fibrosing disease. PFT trends also help; NSIP often shows improvement in FVC on therapy if it’s the inflammatory type.

In summary, if the question is whether an ILD has an NSIP pattern, a **high-resolution CT scan** is the primary basis for saying yes or no. A predominantly ground-glass, symmetric pattern with the aforementioned features would be interpreted as NSIP. If it “still” looks like NSIP on serial scans (i.e. no signs of UIP emerging), clinicians may continue immune-based treatments. The importance of correctly identifying NSIP is highlighted in recent literature by its inclusion in classification updates; experts have noted that grouping ILDs by **phenotype (fibrotic vs inflammatory)** can be more useful for treatment than traditional etiologic classification. NSIP falls on the more **inflammatory** end of the spectrum relative to UIP, so confirming this pattern guides toward therapies like corticosteroids or steroid-sparing immunomodulators (e.g. mycophenolate in scleroderma-NSIP) rather than antifibrotics up front. If unsure, biopsy confirmation can secure the pattern. Thus, identifying an NSIP pattern helps answer “*Is this ILD potentially treatable and associated with CTD?*”.

### **5. Is it CTD-ILD (connective tissue disease–associated ILD)?**

This question addresses whether a patient’s ILD is associated with an underlying connective tissue disease (like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, Sjögren’s, etc.), as opposed to being idiopathic. It’s a crucial distinction because it changes management (adding immunosuppression, treating the CTD) and prognosis, and may exclude the patient from an IPF diagnosis. The assessments inform this determination as follows:

* **Clinical evaluation and labs:** These are front and center. Any signs or symptoms of a CTD (arthritis, skin changes, muscle weakness, dry eyes/mouth, Raynaud’s, etc.) raise suspicion. **Autoimmune serologies** are critical: a high-titer ANA, anti-CCP, anti-Ro, anti-Smith, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo1, U1-RNP, etc., if present, strongly indicate CTD-ILD. For example, if an ILD patient has a positive anti-CCP or rheumatoid factor, plus maybe some joint symptoms, the ILD is likely RA-associated. A **positive anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase)** or **ANA with nucleolar pattern** in an ILD patient suggests systemic sclerosis even if skin changes are minimal. The last 5 years have seen better recognition of subtle autoimmune features; an international task force even defined the entity **IPAF (Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features)** for ILD patients who don’t meet full CTD criteria but have some autoantibodies or clinical hints of autoimmunity. So, interpreting the lab and clinical data is paramount: if a patient fulfills specific criteria for a CTD or IPAF, the answer is “yes, CTD-ILD.”
* **HRCT patterns:** Certain imaging patterns are suggestive of CTD-ILD. **NSIP pattern** (discussed above) is common in systemic sclerosis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and mixed connective tissue disease. **Organizing pneumonia** pattern (patchy consolidations) is seen in RA or inflammatory myopathies. **UIP pattern** can also occur in CTD (especially RA, less commonly SSc). Sometimes ancillary CT findings give clues: enlarged esophagus on CT is frequently seen in scleroderma; pleural effusions or pericardial effusions alongside ILD might hint at lupus or RA; diffuse lymphadenopathy could suggest sarcoid or overlap syndromes. While no HRCT feature is pathognomonic for a CTD, the presence of NSIP in a male patient, for instance, should prompt an autoimmune workup if not already done. Recent studies have highlighted that **ILD onset can precede overt CTD by years**, so identifying a CTD-ILD may actually lead to a new rheumatologic diagnosis. Thus, the tools come full circle: the lab tests (serologies) are often rechecked even if initially negative, and sometimes rheumatology input is sought with tests like nailfold capillaroscopy for occult systemic sclerosis.
* **PFT and 6MWT:** While these do not differentiate CTD-ILD from idiopathic ILD, some CTDs have particular functional profiles. For example, systemic sclerosis can cause isolated DL\_CO reduction (due to pulmonary vascular disease) out of proportion to FVC. A disproportionate drop in DL\_CO with symptoms of dyspnea might suggest pulmonary vascular involvement in a scleroderma patient, which is a clue for concomitant PAH (common in SSc).
* **Histology:** Occasionally, lung biopsy can uncover features suggestive of CTD (like pleuracentric fibrosis, lymphoid aggregates, or an OP pattern with inflammation) even if serologies are negative. But more often, the biopsy patterns overlap between idiopathic and CTD-related ILD, so it’s the clinical context and labs that clinch it.

In practice, to answer “CTD-ILD?” we ask: Does the patient carry a known CTD diagnosis? If not, do they have serologic or clinical evidence of one? For example, a middle-aged woman with ILD, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and ANA 1:1280 speckled pattern – even without skin thickening – would likely be classified as CTD-ILD (perhaps an undefined CTD or “IPAF”). Identifying CTD-ILD is crucial because treatment will target the CTD (immunosuppressives like methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, etc., depending on the disease) and because some therapies for IPF (like antifibrotics) have been used more cautiously in certain CTD-ILD cases (though this is changing with recent trials). High-impact reviews emphasize a systematic approach: **screen all ILD patients for CTD** (history, exam, serologies), and if features are present but not definitive, consider an “IPAF” label and close monitoring by rheumatology. This approach can uncover occult CTDs and ensure patients receive appropriate therapy for the underlying condition.

### **6. What is the ILD disease behavior?** (Stable, improving, or progressive disease course)

ILD “disease behavior” refers to the clinical course over time – some ILDs remain stable for years, some improve with treatment, and others relentlessly progress (fibrose). Determining the behavior is key for prognosis and treatment adjustments. The assessments are used serially to categorize disease behavior:

* **Serial PFTs:** This is the primary tool. If a patient’s FVC and DL\_CO stay within measurement variability (no significant decline) over a year or more, the disease is considered *stable*. Improvement in FVC/DL\_CO (especially if on therapy) suggests a partial remission or successful treatment (as can occur in inflammatory ILDs like organizing pneumonia or NSIP on steroids). Conversely, a decline in FVC (especially ≥10% relative drop) or DL\_CO (>15% drop) indicates *progression*, as noted earlier. Rate of decline also matters: losing 5% FVC per year vs 20% per year are very different trajectories. Recent cohort studies show some ILD patients have an indolent course while others have steep declines; these **lung function trajectories** correlate with survival. Thus, plotting PFTs over time provides an objective measure of disease behavior.
* **Symptoms and functional status:** Tools like the **6MWT and exercise tolerance** complement PFTs. Worsening disease behavior often manifests as decreasing 6MWD or new oxygen requirement over time. Patient-reported outcomes (increasing dyspnea, cough, fatigue) are also critical – an ILD might be considered “progressive” if symptoms worsen, even if FVC drop is marginal (since sometimes fibrosis can progress in ways not fully captured by FVC).
* **Serial imaging:** Although not done as frequently, comparing an interval HRCT to baseline can reveal change in fibrosis. If a scan 1–2 years later shows visibly more reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing, that confirms *progressive fibrosing disease*. Improvement on HRCT (e.g. resolution of ground-glass opacities after immunosuppressive treatment in an organizing pneumonia) would document a positive treatment response. Radiologic progression is one of the domains in recent criteria for “progressive disease.” For example, an increase in fibrotic area on HRCT of >10% would be considered significant progression in some studies. High-resolution CT can sometimes lag or lead PFT changes – occasionally fibrosis can progress without an immediate large PFT drop, or vice versa – hence a combination of clinical, functional, and imaging follow-up gives the best picture.
* **Multidimensional indices:** Some indices combine variables to assess disease behavior. The ILD-GAP model (for IPF, extended to ILDs) can be recalculated over time to see if risk stage changes. **Acute exacerbations** (sudden, acute worsening events in fibrotic ILD) are another aspect of disease behavior; their occurrence generally signals a more aggressive disease.

Recent expert consensus introduced the concept of “**Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis**” (PPF, see next question) to specifically define ILDs (other than IPF) that exhibit a progressive-fibrosing behavior despite standard management. In practice, when monitoring an ILD, clinicians regularly ask: “Is this patient’s ILD stable, improving, or progressing?” If progression is observed, treatment is often escalated (or switched). If stable, current management is continued. If improving, it reinforces treatment efficacy (and one might attempt tapering certain drugs cautiously). High-impact literature stresses close monitoring especially in the first 1–2 years after diagnosis, as this is often when a patient declares their “phenotype” (stable vs progressive). Approximately one-third of non-IPF ILD patients will show a **progressive fibrosing phenotype** over time – identifying those is crucial to intervene appropriately. Thus, by integrating PFT trends, 6MWT changes, symptom trajectories, and occasional imaging updates, one can confidently characterize the disease behavior as of a given point in time.

### **7. Is it Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (PPF)?**

“Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis” (PPF) is a relatively new term that has been defined in recent international guidelines to categorize patients (particularly those **without IPF**) who demonstrate ongoing fibrosis progression. The question essentially asks: does this ILD meet criteria for progressive disease despite treatment? According to the 2022 ATS/ERS consensus, **PPF is defined by having at least *two of the following three* criteria occur within the past year (with no alternative explanation)**:

* **Worsening respiratory symptoms:** e.g. increasing dyspnea on exertion or more frequent cough over 12 months.
* **Physiological decline:** objective loss of lung function, typically measured as a relative decline of ≥5–10% in FVC or ≥10% in DL\_CO in 1 year.
* **Radiological progression:** new or enlarging fibrotic changes on serial HRCT (such as increased extent of reticulation/honeycombing or new traction bronchiectasis).

If a patient fulfills two or more of those domains in a year, they are considered to have **progressive pulmonary fibrosis** (i.e. a progressive-fibrosing ILD phenotype). For example, suppose a patient with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis on therapy reports worse breathlessness and cough, and over the last year their FVC has dropped 8% and their CT shows more fibrosis – this patient meets all three criteria (symptoms, physiology, imaging) and clearly has PPF. On the other hand, if a patient only has an FVC decline but feels the same and imaging is unchanged, that single domain may or may not trigger the PPF label; clinicians would weigh the magnitude of decline and possibly watch closely for a second sign of progression.

The recognition of PPF is important because evidence suggests these patients benefit from a shift in management (notably, consideration of antifibrotic therapy). In fact, as highlighted in an expert consensus, the term “PPF” exactly captures what clinicians see: ILD patients who, despite initial management (such as immunosuppressants for an autoimmune ILD), continue to fibrose and worsen. Such patients have a prognosis and treatment approach akin to IPF. A landmark trial (INBUILD, 2019) showed that **nintedanib** slows FVC decline in a broad group of progressive fibrosing ILDs, confirming that treating PPF with antifibrotics can modify disease course. This has been practice-changing – now, once a patient is identified as having PPF, many experts will recommend starting an antifibrotic (nintedanib, or pirfenidone off-label) in addition to or instead of other therapies. Indeed, the latest international guideline updates include **PPF management**: after addressing any treatable factors (like ensuring the patient was on appropriate primary therapy for their ILD), if progression persists, **early introduction of antifibrotic therapy is advised**.

To determine PPF status in practice, one uses all the tools:

* Regular **PFTs** to catch physiological decline.
* **Symptom review** and perhaps 6MWT to quantify functional change (some propose that new exertional hypoxemia be considered an additional criterion for progression, as it shortens the time to detect meaningful progression).
* Periodic **HRCT** (often at 12 or 24 months, or sooner if clinically indicated) to look for radiologic progression.
* Exclusion of other causes of deterioration (e.g. making sure a decline isn’t due to a heart failure exacerbation, lung infection, or medication side effect – this is the “no alternative explanation” part of the PPF definition).

If PPF is confirmed, it answers the question with a yes – the ILD is in a relentlessly progressive phase that warrants aggressive management. The significance is underscored by outcomes: PPF patients have high morbidity and mortality similar to IPF. On the flip side, if after a few years on appropriate therapy a patient shows no signs of progression, they would not meet PPF criteria and might be monitored on current therapy. It’s an evolving concept, and ongoing research is refining these criteria (for instance, whether to require a specific percent decline or if a shorter timeframe can be used). The 2023 ERS consensus statement on PPF emphasizes both the **importance of early recognition** of PPF and the need for a tailored approach to monitoring in fibrosing ILDs.

### **8. Is antifibrotic therapy recommended?**

This question brings together all of the above to decide on treatment with **antifibrotic medications** (currently pirfenidone and nintedanib) which have been proven to slow fibrosis in certain ILDs. The decision hinges on diagnosis and disease behavior:

* **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** Antifibrotic therapy is *standard of care* for IPF. Multiple trials (ASCEND, CAPACITY for pirfenidone; INPULSIS for nintedanib) showed these drugs slow FVC decline and may improve survival in IPF. Therefore, if the patient **has IPF (UIP with no alternative cause)**, the answer is unequivocally yes – recommend antifibrotic therapy. Current guidelines strongly recommend antifibrotics for IPF, regardless of disease stage (even mild IPF) because they alter disease trajectory.
* **Progressive fibrosing ILDs (PPF):** Based on newer evidence, patients with non-IPF ILDs that meet PPF criteria (see above) are also candidates for antifibrotics. The INBUILD trial published in *NEJM* (2019) demonstrated that nintedanib reduced the rate of lung function decline in a spectrum of progressive ILDs (fibrotic NSIP, chronic HP, unclassifiable ILD, etc.). Subsequent systematic reviews and real-world studies have echoed this benefit. Pirfenidone has shown signals of benefit in progressive unclassifiable ILD (a phase II trial in *Lancet Respir Med* 2020 found pirfenidone had a smaller FVC decline versus placebo over 24 weeks). Thus, current expert consensus is to **consider antifibrotics in any fibrosing ILD that is progressively worsening despite standard therapy**. For example, if a patient with rheumatoid arthritis-ILD continues to progress (declining lung volumes, worsening fibrosis on CT) despite immunosuppressants, adding an antifibrotic like nintedanib is now advised (nintedanib is approved for RA-ILD with progression in some regions).
* **Non-progressive fibrotic ILD:** If an ILD is fibrotic but *stable*, the benefit of antifibrotics is less clear, and current guidelines do not routinely recommend antifibrotics for stable disease. One must also consider drug tolerability and patient factors. For instance, a patient with chronic fibrotic HP who is stable on antigen avoidance and immunosuppression may be observed without antifibrotics unless they start to progress.
* **Predominantly inflammatory ILDs:** In diseases where fibrosis is minimal or inflammation predominates (e.g. acute organizing pneumonia, or cellular NSIP early on), the first-line is immunomodulatory therapy, not antifibrotic. Antifibrotics are not indicated in purely inflammatory or reversible ILDs. One exception might be scleroderma-ILD: the SENSCIS trial (NEJM 2019) showed nintedanib slowed FVC decline in systemic sclerosis ILD, and nintedanib is FDA-approved for that indication. So even in an autoimmune ILD, if fibrosis is significant, an antifibrotic can be used alongside immune therapy.
* **Patient factors:** We also interpret factors like lung function level and comorbidities. Guidelines in some countries restrict antifibrotics to certain lung function ranges (historically FVC 50–80% for IPF, though this is expanding). But increasingly, the trend is to use antifibrotics even in relatively preserved lung function if disease is likely to progress, to **prevent decline early**. Tolerability (GI side effects with nintedanib, liver enzyme monitoring, photosensitivity with pirfenidone) and patient preference are also considered.

Thus, to answer “Is antifibrotic therapy recommended?”, one essentially assesses: **Diagnosis + Disease Course.** If it’s IPF – yes (virtually always, barring contraindication). If it’s another ILD but showing a progressive fibrotic phenotype – yes (evidence-supported in the last few years). If it’s a non-progressive or primarily inflammatory ILD – not at this time, focus on other therapies (or watchful waiting). This approach is reflected in 2022 international guideline updates, which introduced the concept of PPF to guide therapy: they gave a conditional recommendation to use nintedanib in progressive fibrosis beyond IPF, and similarly noted that clinicians may consider pirfenidone in certain progressive cases despite more limited data. Experts emphasize **early intervention** in PPF – waiting until a patient loses a large amount of lung function can be detrimental. Therefore, once ILD progression is documented, the threshold to start antifibrotic therapy is now low. It’s also worth noting that antifibrotics do not reverse fibrosis; their goal is to slow further decline. So, they are typically **continued indefinitely** if tolerated, and monitoring is done via serial PFTs to ensure the decline has indeed slowed.

In summary, **high-impact evidence from the past 5 years has expanded antifibrotic therapy from IPF to a wider ILD population characterized by progressive fibrosis**. Clinicians use the information gathered from HRCT, PFTs, etc., to decide if a patient falls into that category. If yes, antifibrotic therapy is recommended as part of a comprehensive management plan (often alongside treatment of any underlying cause and supportive care like pulmonary rehabilitation). This approach aims to improve long-term outcomes by addressing fibrosis early and was a notable paradigm shift highlighted in journals like *The Lancet Respiratory Medicine* and *AJRCCM* during this period.
